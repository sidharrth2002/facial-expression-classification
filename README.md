Facial Expression Detection with a Convolutional Neural Network.
Part of a pipeline that includes API deployment (scratch that, the model was only trained with 48x48 pixel images). Dataset source is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge).
